The solution to the problems in IP_Practical02Week03.pdf:

Level 1: Interacting with BlueJ

a. Draw a picture of a house and Sun

1. Use the new() methods to instantiate objects
2. Use the makeVisible() methods of the objects to make them visible
3. move the shapes arounds by trial and error by calling
   moveHorizontal(int), moveVertical(int)
4. change colors using changeColor(String)
5. ensure proper layering by changing moveHorizontal(1), then
   moveHorizontal(-1) -- the last shape moved will be brought to front,
   obscuring other overlapping shapes
6. take screen-shot (viz file "Houses and Suns.png")


b. Draw one's initials using Turtle

/* draw "J" */

pen.penDown()
pen.right(120)
pen.forward(30)
pen.left(120)
pen.forward(120)
pen.penUp()


/* move over */

pen.right(90)
pen.forward(30)
pen.right(90)


/* draw "M" */

pen.penDown()
pen.forward(120)
pen.right(180)
pen.forward(120)
pen.right(150)
pen.forward(70)
pen.left(120)
pen.forward(70)
pen.left(210)
pen.forward(120)
pen.penUp() // not strictly necessary


viz screen-shot (file "Initials -- JM.png")


c. LabClass BlueJ project

Enrolling more students than a capacity of the class results in an error
message: "The class is full, you cannot enrol." -- viz screenshot (file
"lab-classes.log.screenshot.png").
